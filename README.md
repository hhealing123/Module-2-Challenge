# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

This assignment is about creating professional protfolio without any given starter code; instead, I was told to create a web application from scratch!
A portfolio of work is a must item when it comes to show my skills and talents to employers who are looking for a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio should entail my strongest work as well as the thought process behind it.

## Steps taken to create a portfolio.
* Brainstorm how and what I will be adding to my portfolio. (I created a Wireframe document to better organize my ideas to effectively create my portfolio).
* Added descriptive title that best describe my portfolio page.
* Added tags to be more semantic tags to reduce confusion and easier for others and me to understand. 
  * Example I: Instead of using div tags all over the place, I used section and article tags to divide my contents.
  * Example II: I used footer tag instead of using div tag to emphasize that the last content of the portfolio is a footer.
* Added necessary attributes to make my codes more effective.
  * Example I: Added alt to img tag to prevent a case where the image fails to load.
  * Example II: Gave type, value, and etc. attributes to input tags so that my Contact Form works properly.
* Grouped clases in HTML that will have same styles codes in CSS.
  * Example: Instead of using flex for all new sections, I gave each section a class, "content", to apply same styles to the sections.
* Commented HTML and CSS to provide more context, as well as providing explanation of what each codes do.
* Finally, created a repository and pushed all necessary files for this challenge!
