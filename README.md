# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

This assignment is about creating professional protfolio without any given starter code; instead, I was told to create a web application from scratch!
A portfolio of work is a must item when it comes to show my skills and talents to employers who are looking for a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio should entail my strongest work as well as the thought process behind it.

## Steps taken to create a portfolio.
* Brainstorm how and what I will be adding to my portfolio. (I created a Wireframe document to better organize my ideas to effectively create my portfolio).
* Added descriptive title that best describe my portfolio page.
* Added tags to be more semantic tags to reduce confusion and easier for others and me to understand. 
  * Example I: Instead of using div tags all over the place, I used section and article tags to divide my contents.
  * Example II: I used footer tag instead of using div tag to emphasize that the last content of the portfolio is a footer.
* Added necessary attributes to make my codes more effective.
  * Example I: Added alt to img tag to prevent a case where the image fails to load.
  * Example II: Gave type, value, and etc. attributes to input tags so that my Contact Form works properly.
* Grouped clases in HTML that will have same styles codes in CSS.
  * Example: Instead of using flex for all new sections, I gave each section a class, "content", to apply same styles to the sections.
* Commented HTML and CSS to provide more context, as well as providing explanation of what each codes do.
* Finally, created a repository and pushed all necessary files for this challenge! 

## Challenges that I went through when creating this personal portfolio...
* Since I do not have much experience in HTML and CSS (especially creating everything from a scratch), it was really hard for me to organize everything, such as what tags I should use, how I should organize the portfolio, and what styles I would have to apply for each content sections to make my portfolio appealing and organized. Hence, I had to google some sample HTML portfolio to see what the portfolio should look like and how it should be organized, as well as what the portfolio should include.
* Using correct class tags and improvising CSS codes were really hard (I somewhat managed to combine similar styles in CSS by using same class that had same styles but it still is not the perfect way of organzing the codes). I tried overcomming this problem by carefully reading my codes and identify parts where it would have same styles.
* Creating my own repository and push this portfolio challenge gave me a little issue. 
  * For some odd reason, pushing files would not work so I had to watch couple youtube vidoes to better understand the mechanices of Github.
* Finally, selecting the appropriate styles to the portfolio was extremly hard. Each individual has differrent taste and there are numerous ways to organize structure of portfolio; hence, this part took the longest for me because I initially did not like the way my portfolio was structured, and the styles that I applied were horrible. I overcame this trouble by doing numerous attempts of revising and experimenting my codes by applying different styles to determine the best styles that would be suitable for my portfolio.
